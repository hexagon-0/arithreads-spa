This is only a client, you'll also need to have the [API](https://github.com/hexagon-0/arithreads-api)
running.

Copy `.env.example` as `.env.local` and update `VITE_API_URL` to point to the
URL of your API. The default value matches the API defaults.

To serve the client locally run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

Navigate to the URL output by Vite e.g. http://localhost:5173/ in your web browser.
